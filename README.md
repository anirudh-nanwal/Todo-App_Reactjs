# Plan Todos App

This is a web app developed using Reactjs and typescript libraries. This app currently under development phase but majority of the features are developed and hence, has been deployed on github pages (https://anirudh-nanwal.github.io/Todo-App_Reactjs/). Following is the list of features that this app supports ( or will be available in the future):
1. Week View
2. List View
3. Sort todos
4. Filter todos
5. Add Todos
6. Delete Todos
7. Todos Priority (not developed)
8. Edit Todos (not developed)
9. User login (not developed)

Also, the data is static as the backend services are not yet developed. Hence, the User Login feature will be developed after the backend services have been developed and integrated with the application.

### Note
If you have any suggestions regarding a new feature or code styles or need help in understanding some logic or code regarding this application, feel free to contact me at anirudhnanwal@gmail.com .
