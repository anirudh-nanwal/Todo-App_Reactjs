#Plan Todos App

This is a web app developed using Reactjs and typescript libraries. This app currently under development phase but majority of the features are developed and hence, has been deployed on github pages (https://anirudh-nanwal.github.io/Todo-App_Reactjs/). Following is the list of features that this app supports ( or will be available in the future):
1. Week View
2. List View
3. Sort todos (not developed)
4. Filter todos (not developed)
5. Add Todos
6. Delete Todos (not developed)
7. Edit Todos (not developed)
8. User login (not developed)

Also, the data is static as the backend services are not yet developed. Hence, the User Login feature will be developed after the backend services have been developed and integrated with the application.

###Note
